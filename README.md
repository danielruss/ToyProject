# This is my toy project

This the the default readme file.  This file is written in markdown, which can format text nicely for the web. I will try to create addition documentation for this project using  [BOOTSTRAP 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).  Notice that I created a link to the Bootstrap 4 website.

You can create different header levels.
# Header 1
I used this at the top of the file.
## Header 2
### Header 3

**Bold**, *Italic*, and ~~Strikethrough~~ text are also available.
